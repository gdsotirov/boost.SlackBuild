About Boost's documentation

The documentation of Boost distributed in the official release is
pre-generated and not well suited to offline browsing (e.g. it includes
many relative references to the boost package structure, which could not
be easily represented into Slackware's package structure).

Therefore, I suggest you use the online documentation at
https://www.boost.org/doc/ - it's always accurate and updated.
